## 🌟 About FarmConnect Kenya

**FarmConnect Kenya** is a revolutionary digital platform designed to bridge the gap between Kenya's 6 million smallholder farmers and profitable markets.

- 📊 **Low productivity** - Only 1.2 tons per hectare vs. global average of 5.9 tons
- 🔍 **Information gaps** - Limited access to real-time market data
- 🤝 **Market access barriers** - Difficulty connecting with verified buyers
